          All players sometimes have off games. Sometimes your enemies or teammates are trolling, throwing, griefing or smurfing. 
          Such games hardly represent your true skill. In order to filter out
          these games, we exclude the bottom ten percent of games and the top
          ten percent of games based on kill / death average.
